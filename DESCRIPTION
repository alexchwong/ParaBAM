Description: Although various tools for multi-threaded BAM processing (samtools,
	sambamba) are available, currently there are none available to the 
	R/Bioconductor environment. Parallelism in R is achieved using BiocParallel 
	or related packages. Typical alternatives include processing multiple BAM 
	files, each using a single core. Although easy to set up, memory-intensive
	applications limit such approaches. ompBAM is a header-only C++ library 
	based on OpenMP, allowing developers to implement OpenMP-based parallelism 
	for the sequential reading of BAM files. ompBAM makes it easy by handling 
	all the parallel file-access and bgzf decompression, allowing developers to 
	focus on multi-threaded handling of individual reads.
